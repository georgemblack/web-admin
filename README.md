# Web Admin

## Running Locally

Assuming you have:

* A recent version of `node`
* `yarn` package manager

First, start the mock API to develop against:

```
cd mock && yarn && yarn start
```

Then, in a new terminal, start the dev server:

```
yarn && yarn start
```

That's it!

## Infrastructure

The Web Admin UI is hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
